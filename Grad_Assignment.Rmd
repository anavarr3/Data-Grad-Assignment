#^ Here I checked to see if I should keep the document column in. It seems like these links are invalid, so I'm going to select them out for now.

 # group_by(inspection_reason) |> 
 # summarise(count=n())
 #^ Here I wanted to see if there was any reason to keep the "inspection_reason" column. Unfortunately, it's all NA, so I took it out.

#Next step: split city, state, zip and see if there are any outside of MD.
